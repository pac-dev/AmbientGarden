			<h1>Ambient.Garden: a landscape of generative music</h1>
			<p>
			Ambient.Garden is a music composition arranged in space rather than
			time. Moving through the space is moving though the music. The
			autopilot is a suggested path though the music, and can be
			disabled to freely explore.
			</p>
			<p>
			Each tree links to the source code of its generative sound. This
			code can be experimented with to move deeper into the sound.
			</p>
			<p>
			To protect the serene atmosphere, bicycles and jogging are not
			permitted within the Garden. Please respect the musical plants and
			wildlife, and leave no trace!
